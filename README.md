# CGPA Calculator C++

This is a simple console-based GPA (Grade Point Average) and CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) calculator implemented in C++. The program allows users to input their grades, credit hours, and number of courses for multiple semesters, and calculates both the GPA for each semester and the overall CGPA.


## Features

**• Grade to Grade Point Conversion:** Converts letter grades (e.g., A+, B-, C) into grade points based on a 4.0 scale.

**• Semester-wise GPA Calculation:** Computes the GPA for each semester based on the input grades and credit hours for the courses.

**• Cumulative CGPA Calculation:** Computes the CGPA across all semesters entered.

**• Dynamic Input Handling:** Allows the user to input the number of semesters and the number of courses for each semester.

## Notes

**• Grade Input:** The program expects grades in the format provided (e.g., A, B+, C-). Any other input will be treated as 0.0 grade points.

**• Credit Hours:** Ensure that the number of credit hours entered for each course is a positive integer.
